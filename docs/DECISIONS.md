# Decisions

Every place the build diverges from `CLAUDE.md`, or settles something the spec left open,
with the reason. Newest last. A later session must not undo an entry here without adding a new
entry that says why.

Format: **D-NNN · date · spec section** — what was decided, then why.

**D-001 · 2026-09-27 · header** — The project is called **floorcall**, not cadence.
"cadence" is taken by `cadence-workflow/cadence` on GitHub (Uber's workflow engine, ~9.4k stars)
and by `ai4bharat/Cadence` on Hugging Face, a punctuation-restoration model for speech text, which
sits in this project's own domain. "floorcall" had no GitHub repositories, no PyPI package and no
Hugging Face models on the day it was checked. "Holding the floor" is the conversation-analysis
term for having the turn; the "call" is the decision about it.

**D-002 · 2026-09-27 · §8** — The TensorFlow warning comes from Laya's **CI config**, not its
README. `laya-src/.github/workflows/ci.yml` at commit `9d95567` says: "transformers probes for
TensorFlow at import; when TF is present its abseil runtime can deadlock model construction."
The rule (never install TF here) stands. `tests/test_environment.py` fails if `tensorflow`
becomes importable.

**D-003 · 2026-09-27 · §1, §2, §12 Table B** — "One pass" means **one batched forward call**, not
one encoder pass shared across questions. In Laya 0.3.21 each question is its own input row:

```
[CLS] <type> question: <instructions> [SEP] [MASK] opt0 [MASK] opt1 ... [SEP] <state> [SEP]
```

(`laya/common.py::build_sequence`). `Agent.predict` tokenizes the state once, builds one row per
question, and runs all rows through the encoder together. So asking three questions costs one
forward call with batch dimension 3, and the encoder reads the state three times. The saving over
three sequential calls is batching parallelism plus the per-call overhead paid once. That is
likely a real win on GPU and possibly a small one on CPU, where Laya's own README reports batching
may not help. Table B measures this directly instead of assuming it. README and model-card wording
must say "one forward call" or "one batched pass", never "one encoder pass".

**D-004 · 2026-09-27 · §5** — The state token budget is derived from the checkpoint, per event.
The English `laya` checkpoint has `max_len=512` and `head_max_len=192`. The instructions and
options take the front of each row, and the state gets whatever room remains
(`max_len - len(prefix) - 1`). That room differs per question, so the packer's budget for an event
is the **minimum room across the questions that event asks**, computed by the adapter with the real
tokenizer on the real question schemas, minus a safety margin set in `config.py`. Laya
right-truncates a dict state silently when it overflows. The adapter therefore re-checks every
packed state and raises if any row would truncate, which enforces the spec's "a state that exceeds
the budget is a bug".

**D-005 · 2026-09-27 · §4** — Every `noul` question (D1, D4, D5) carries explicit `true` / `false`
criteria. On the English checkpoint, a `noul` with no criteria renders a generic option pair that
"carries the whole decision, so it answers 'no' whatever the state" (Laya README, Honest limits,
issue #156). `choice` labels avoid boolean words (`yes` / `no` / `true` / `false`) for the same
reason.

**D-006 · 2026-09-27 · §4 D1/D2** — SwDA is read from the original corpus CSVs at
`https://github.com/cgpotts/swda/raw/master/swda.zip`, not through Hugging Face `datasets`. The HF
entry `cgpotts/swda` contains only a loading script, which current `datasets` releases no longer
execute, and it has no parquet conversion. The CSVs are what that script downloaded anyway.
Licence: CC BY-NC-SA 3.0, so the derived dataset is non-commercial and must say so on its card.

**D-007 · 2026-09-27 · §8** — The torch build is chosen explicitly, through two mutually exclusive
dependency groups: `cu130` (a default group, so a plain `uv sync` / `uv run` on the GPU box gets
it) and `cpu` (CI: `uv sync --no-default-groups --group dev --group cpu`). On Windows the PyPI
torch wheel is CPU-only, and the RTX 5070 Ti Laptop GPU (Blackwell, compute capability 12.0,
sm_120) needs CUDA 12.8 or newer. cu130 matches the installed driver (CUDA 13.1). Verified:
`torch 2.14.0+cu130` lists `sm_120` and runs a bf16 matmul on the card.

**D-008 · 2026-09-27 · §13** — The GitHub repository stays **private** until Table A has measured
rows, then goes public. The history is kept either way. (Yash's call.)

**D-009 · 2026-09-27 · §4 D4, §10.2** — All four test sets, including Yash's hand-labelled D4 set,
are frozen before the first training run, as the spec says. Training waits on the D4 labels.
(Yash's call; the alternative was a D1–D3 run first.)

**D-010 · 2026-09-27 · §12 Table B** — Laya silently falls back to CPU when it cannot place the
model on the GPU (`Agent.__init__`, and `_infer` on OOM). It prints a warning but does not raise.
On a Blackwell card with a torch build that lacks sm_120 support, a "GPU" latency row would then
quietly be a CPU number. The latency harness reads the device the model actually runs on after
loading and after timing, and refuses to write a GPU row if either reads anything but `cuda`.

**D-011 · 2026-09-27 · §8** — The torch variants are dependency groups, not extras. They were
first written as extras (`--extra cu130`). A later bare `uv run` then re-synced the environment to
the no-extra set and silently replaced `torch 2.14.0+cu130` with `2.14.0+cpu`. Any "GPU" run after
that would have been a CPU run without an error. uv has no environment variable for a sticky extra,
but it does have `default-groups`, so the CUDA build is now a default group and the CPU build is
opted into explicitly.
